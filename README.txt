MAxSym
------
MAxSym is a MATLAB tool for the simulation of two-dimensional, axi-symmetric groundwater flow 

- File "MAxSym Manual.pdf" is the manual that describes in detail: 

  (1) the theorical background of the applied finite-difference method
  (2) the simulation of existing analytical models using MAxSym
  (3) the object oriented structure of the MATLAB code
  
- Folder "+MAxSym" contains the m-files and mex-files to run MAxSym in MATLAB R2013b (64bit).

- Folder "Examples" contains the scripts discussed in the manual.

- File "License.txt" gives the terms and conditions of the “New BSD license”, a certified open source license,
  under which it is allowed to redistribute MAxSym. MAxSym is free software for academic and research purposes only.
